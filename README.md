# AllTextInOneLineConverterBo

This is a simple Python script that uses the `telegram` library to create a bot that can convert multi-line text into a single line.

## Usage

1. Replace `API_KEY GOES HERE` with your own Telegram bot API key.
2. Run the script: `python telegram_bot.py`
3. Interact with the bot by sending it the `/start` or `/help` command, or by pasting multi-line text.
4. The bot will reply with the converted text, which you can click to copy.
